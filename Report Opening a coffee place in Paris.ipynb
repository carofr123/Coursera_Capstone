Then I merged the neighborhood/density table with the geolocalisation table that display the latitude and longitude for each neighborhood in Paris. I then used folium to display a map of Paris and its different neighborhoods. I then used Four Square to identify all the different competitors per neighborhood and I created a folium map to represent their locations. I then segmented and clustered the different neighborhoods per place of interests, I summarized in a table the 10th most common venues per neighborhood. then i decided to segment the neighborhood around 5 clusters using k-means clustering method and I represented the different clusters using different colors on the folium map of Prais. I organized the the clusters and display all the venues per cluster."

The cluster 0 (red) is the cluster that gather the most active areas of Paris with restaurants, coffees, hotels, touristic places and those areas are also part of the nightlife of Paris so they are the most visted. The cluster 1 and 2 include areas that are more residentials where you could find more families activities like lakes/zoos.

As we highlighted the importance to pick a neighborhood where there is a balance between the number of competitirs and the number of potential customers, i would avoid the 3e,4e and 5e district where the competition seems to be too high but i would focus on the other dense areas like the 11e(Popincourt), 18e(Buttes Montmartre), 10e(Entrepot) and 20e(Menilmontant). Those areas are frequently visited and include restaurant , bars, bistrots, baleries which would ensure enough visits and we can see that there is a limited numbers of coffee shops , not to much competition as they are not part of teh two most common venues."
