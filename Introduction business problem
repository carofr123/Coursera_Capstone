Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.
This submission will eventually become your Introduction/Business Problem section in your final report. So I recommend that you push the report (having your Introduction/Business Problem section only for now) to your Github repository and submit a link to it.

The idea of this study is to help entrepreneurs that are planning to open a new coffee place in Paris to choose the right location by providing data for each neighbourhood as well as the competitors present in the neighborhood. 
Competitors is one of the most important factors when opening a coffee place because even if the coffee place is perfect, you may find it difficult to do business if the closest 50 places are also coffee shops.
It is important to pick a neighborhood where there is a balance between the number of competitors and the number of potential customers.
